# Tesla Tariff Impact Analysis: A Case Study

This repository contains a detailed case study on the impact of tariffs on Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) sales across various European markets. The study includes predictive analysis, data visualization, and insights that can help Tesla implement strategies to regain market share and trust in the EU. This analysis is conducted using advanced data analytics techniques with RStudio, including **2D stadia maps**, **3D plot visualizations**, and **predictive analysis**.

### **Project Overview**
In this case study, we explore the significant drop in Tesla's sales due to political backlash and changing market conditions. Specifically, we focus on the following key aspects:
- Analyzing the impact of tariffs on the sales performance of Tesla in Germany, France, Norway, and the UK.
- Visualizing the data with interactive and informative 2D and 3D plots.
- Suggesting strategies Tesla could use to shield itself from tariffs and regain the EU's trust.

### **Why This Matters**
The electric vehicle (EV) market in Europe is extremely competitive, and Tesla's sales have been severely impacted by external factors, including tariffs and political influence. As Tesla looks to continue its expansion and maintain its dominant market position, understanding how to mitigate these factors is crucial. This case study provides insights on how Tesla can employ tactics such as **local production**, **political engagement**, and **government subsidies** to recover market share.

## **Professional Summary**

In this case study, we address the challenges Tesla faces in Europe, particularly regarding the recent decline in EV sales across key markets like Germany, France, Norway, and the UK. Tesla's sharp decline in sales has been attributed to a series of factors, including a backlash against Elon Musk’s political influence and reduced government subsidies for EV buyers.

The study leverages various data analytics techniques to:
1. Visualize the decrease in sales using **3D plots** and **2D stadia maps**.
2. Suggest strategies that could help Tesla regain market trust and protect its market share from the ongoing effects of tariffs.
3. Provide a clear, data-driven insight into how local production, political engagement, and government subsidies could help mitigate the sales decline.

The visualizations and predictive analysis in this report can help guide Tesla's strategies in Europe by offering actionable recommendations based on solid data.

country_sales_data <- data.frame(
  country = c("Germany", "France", "Norway", "UK"),
  sales_percentage = c(59.5, 63, 38, 8)
)

# Create a basic 2D map
map <- leaflet(country_sales_data) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = c(10.4515, 2.2137, 10.757, -0.1278),
             lat = c(51.1657, 46.6034, 60.472, 51.5074),
             popup = ~paste(country, "Sales drop: ", sales_percentage, "%"))

# Show the map

```

### **3D Plot of Decreased Sales by Country**

This interactive 3D plot visualizes the decrease in Tesla sales across different countries, helping us understand the impact of tariffs and political influences.

```r
# R code for a 3D Plot using plotly
library(plotly)

# Sales drop data for each country
country_sales <- data.frame(
  country = c("Germany", "France", "Norway", "UK"),
  sales_drop = c(59.5, 63, 38, 8)
)

# 3D plot creation
fig <- plot_ly(country_sales, 
               x = ~country, 
               y = ~sales_drop, 
               z = ~sales_drop, 
               type = 'scatter3d', 
               mode = 'markers', 
               marker = list(size = 10, color = ~sales_drop, colorscale = 'Viridis')) %>%

## **Predictive Analysis**

Predictive analysis involves exploring potential strategies Tesla can employ to mitigate the effects of tariffs and regain trust. By analyzing the data from various countries, we can identify which strategies (local production, political engagement, and government subsidies) are most likely to yield positive results for Tesla in the face of political and market challenges.

### **Potential Strategies for Success**
1. **Local Production**: Countries like Germany, with the highest sales drop, will benefit from increased local production. This strategy not only minimizes tariff exposure but also aligns with growing demands for localized manufacturing.
2. **Political Engagement**: Countries like France and Norway, with a significant backlash, can benefit from improved political engagement, ensuring Tesla’s image aligns more closely with regional policies.
3. **Government Subsidies**: Renewing or introducing new government subsidies could provide immediate relief in markets like the UK and France, helping Tesla recover sales in these regions.

## **Why This Matters**

The global automotive industry is moving rapidly towards electric vehicles, and Tesla must stay ahead of the competition. Tariffs and political challenges can severely hinder Tesla's growth. By identifying the right strategies, Tesla can navigate these challenges more effectively and strengthen its presence in the EU market. This case study provides critical insights on how Tesla can implement localized strategies to ensure long-term success.

---

## **Conclusion**

This case study highlights the importance of understanding external market forces such as tariffs, political engagement, and government subsidies. Through advanced data analysis, including **interactive 2D stadia maps**, **3D plots**, and **predictive modeling**, we have identified actionable strategies for Tesla to shield itself from market disruptions and restore its market share in Europe. This project serves as an example of how data-driven decision-making can assist in corporate strategy formulation and market adaptation.
